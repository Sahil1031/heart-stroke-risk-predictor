This Streamlit web application, developed by Sahil Bagde, predicts the risk of heart disease or stroke using a machine learning model trained on health data. Leveraging a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier, the app takes user inputs such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, ECG results, and other cardiac indicators to deliver a simple and actionable risk assessment.

The app features a clean, intuitive interface with tooltips for each health parameter, helping users understand what the inputs represent. A professional sidebar includes author information and a clear disclaimer emphasizing that the tool is for informational purposes only and must not replace medical advice from qualified professionals.

This project demonstrates end-to-end ML deployment using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and Streamlit. It is ideal for learners seeking hands-on practice with healthcare data, model serving, and user-friendly data science applications.

Feel free to explore, test with your own data, and extend the app with new features or improved models.
